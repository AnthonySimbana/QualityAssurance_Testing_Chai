# Quality Assurance with Chai

Part 1/3 of the Quality Assurance Certification from freeCodeCamp

This is a repository from freeCodeCamp about (Quality Assurance) QA using chai to test.

Chai is a JavaScript testing library that helps you confirm that your program still behaves the way you expect it to after you make changes to your code.

Using Chai, you can write tests that describe your program's requirements and see if your program meets them.

This project use assertions, deep equality, truthiness, testing APIs, and other fundamentals for testing JavaScript applications.

This is the boilerplate for the Quality Assurance with Chai lessons. Instructions for completing these lessons start at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/quality-assurance-and-testing-with-chai/

This repository may function better in replit just like indicate here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/quality-assurance-and-testing-with-chai/learn-how-javascript-assertions-work
- clone this repository
- Use our Replit starter project to complete these challenges. (https://replit.com/github/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-mochachai)
- Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project. Be sure to incorporate all the files from our GitHub repo.

If you use Replit, follow these steps to set up the project:
- Start by importing the project on Replit.
- Next, you will see a .replit window.
- Select Use run command and click the Done button.

  Some test have an URL, this URL must be changed according to each project created in Replit, and it will have the structure:
